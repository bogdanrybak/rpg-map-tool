RPG Map Tool - a jQuery plugin for simple map manipulation
==========================================================

Project in very early phase. For now save your map JPG as images/map.jpg.

## Why ?
The goal of this project is to create a tool for Dungeon Masters to quickly manage their players and NPCs on their pre-made map. Current free RPG mapping web applications fail to accomplish management during the game in a quick and seamless way.
